# 📚 Reference Materials

This directory serves as the central knowledge base for the project. It contains all external documentation, research papers, datasheets, and manuals relevant to running Vision-Language Models on edge devices.

## 📂 Organization Rules

To maintain order, please adhere to the following when adding new resources:

1.  **Categorization:** Do not dump loose files here. Create a new folder for each distinct set of resources (e.g., `Qualcomm_Manuals`, `LLaVA_Papers`, `SigLIP_Architecture`).
2.  **Naming:** Ensure all files and folders are named clearly and descriptively. Avoid generic names like `doc1.pdf` or `temp`.
3.  **Scope:** Only include materials directly relevant to VLM optimization, edge deployment, or specific hardware (QIDK/Hexagon).
